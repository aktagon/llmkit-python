## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `Options(thinking_budget=N)` now produces `{"thinking": {"budget_tokens": N, "type": "enabled"}}` for Anthropic, instead of a flat `"thinking.budget_tokens"` key the server silently ignored. **Behaviour change**: callers that already passed `thinking_budget` will now actually engage Anthropic extended thinking on supported models — expect higher latency and additional reasoning tokens in `Response.tokens.reasoning`. No code change required to opt in. To opt out, omit the option.
- Provider option overrides with dotted JSON keys (e.g. Google's `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`) are now correctly nested. Previously such options were dropped silently.

### Added

- `merge_into_parent` helper in `llmkit.paths` for attaching sibling fields to a dotted JSON path.
